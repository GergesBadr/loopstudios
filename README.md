# Loopstudios landing page
It has been a while since I have completed a [frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge,
 so I decided to take a couple hours implementing this simple and beautiful [Loopstudios landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw).

> 🙋‍♂️ **Fact:** This website is build using ReactJS, and TailwindCSS. The most beautiful combination in frontend development at all!
